    <p> My favorite culture that I am not native to would be Japan, or atleast my idea of it. Growing up watching Studio Ghibli movies has given me a whimsical nostalgia for the country. I hope to visit someday.</p>
    <p> Leif Erikson and William Shakespeare. The former due to my inherent wanderlust, and the latter for always having stories and poems in my head.

    <p> A meal that represents me is soup. As funny as it would be to not have an explanation, I believe soup represents me because I too am  made up of a multitude of different things that come together to form something absolutely delicious. </p>
    <p> I feel most creative when I truly let myself go.</p>
